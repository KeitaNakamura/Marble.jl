    SpArray{T}(dims...)

`SpArray` is a kind of sparse array, but it is not allowed to freely change the value like `Array`:

For example, trying to `setindex!` doesn't change anything without any errors as
```jldoctest sparray
julia> A = Marble.SpArray{Float64}(5,5)
5×5 Marble.SpArray{Float64, 2, Vector{Float64}}:
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅

julia> A[1,1]
0.0

julia> A[1,1] = 2
2

julia> A[1,1]
0.0
```

This is because the index `(1,1)` is not activated yet.
To activate the index, modify sparsity pattern `A.spat` and do `Metal.reinit!(A)`.

```jl sparray
julia> A.spat[1,1] = true
true

julia> A[1,1] = 2; A[1,1] # still can't change anything before doing `reinit!`
0.0

julia> Marble.reinit!(A)
5×5 Marble.SpArray{Float64, 2, Vector{Float64}}:
 2.17321e-314  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
  ⋅            ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
  ⋅            ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
  ⋅            ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
  ⋅            ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅

julia> A[1,1] = 2; A[1,1] # finally can change the value
2.0
```

Although the inactive indices return zero value when using `getindex`,
the behaviors in array calculation is similar to `missing` value rather than zero value:

```jldoctest sparray; setup = :(A.spat[1,1]=true; Marble.reinit!(A); A[1,1]=2)
julia> A
5×5 Marble.SpArray{Float64, 2, Vector{Float64}}:
 2.0  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
  ⋅   ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
  ⋅   ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
  ⋅   ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
  ⋅   ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅

julia> C = rand(5,5)
5×5 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.579862   0.639562  0.566704  0.870539  0.526344
 0.411294   0.839622  0.536369  0.962715  0.0779683
 0.972136   0.967143  0.711389  0.15118   0.966197
 0.0149088  0.789764  0.103929  0.715355  0.666558
 0.520355   0.696041  0.806704  0.939548  0.131026

julia> A + C
5×5 Marble.SpArray{Float64, 2, Vector{Float64}}:
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅

julia> 3A
5×5 Marble.SpArray{Float64, 2, Vector{Float64}}:
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
```

Thus, inactive indices are propagated as

```jldoctest sparray
julia> B = Marble.SpArray{Float64}(5,5);

julia> B.spat[3,3] = true; Marble.reinit!(B); B[3,3] = 8.0;

julia> B
5×5 Marble.SpArray{Float64, 2, Vector{Float64}}:

 ⋅  ⋅  8.0  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅   ⋅   ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅   ⋅   ⋅  ⋅
